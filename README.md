# Final-Project
API Application that provides insights into public health trends in different U.S cities using data on diseases, vaccinations, etcâ€¦
API Methods: Disease Statistics: Take a region (e.g., state or city) and return the current statistics for diseases like flu, COVID-19, or other infectious diseases, using public health data sources like the CDC. Vaccination Rates: Return vaccination statistics for a region, breaking down by type of vaccine and age group. Trend Analysis: Given a region and a specific disease, provide historical trends (how cases or deaths have changed over the past months or years). Comparison Tool: Take two or more regions and compare their vaccination rates, disease statistics, or other health metrics. Risk Assessment: Given a region, return the current risk level for disease spread based on data such as infection rates and vaccination coverage.
Execution Plan:
Week 4: Access public health APIs (CDC, WHO) or datasets and ensure the data is reliable.
Week 5: Use backup data sources if needed.
Week 6: Implement disease statistics and vaccination rate retrieval methods.
Week 7: Implement trend analysis and comparison tools.
Week 8: Wrap the code into an API, allowing others to query health data via the API.
